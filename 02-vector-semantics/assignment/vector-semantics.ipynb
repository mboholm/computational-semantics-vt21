    "\n",
    "(i) process the dataset, extract pairs of `reference - landmark high` and `reference - landmark low`; you can use the code from the lecture as something to start with. Note that there are 2 landmarks for each reference: one landmark exhibits high similarity with the reference, while another one has low similarity with the reference. A single human participant could have evaluated both of these pairs. For more details, we refer you to the paper.  \n",

    "(ii) build models of semantic phrase composition: in the lecture we introduced simple additive, simple multiplicative and combined models (details are in [2]). Your task is to take a single pair (a reference or a high similarity landmark or a low similarity landmark) and compute the composition of its vectors using each of these functions. Thus, you will have three compositional models that take a `noun - verb` pair and output a single vector, representing the meaning of this pair. As your semantic space, you can use pretrained spaces (standard space, ppmi or svd) introduced above. It is up to you which space you use, but for someone who runs your code, it should be pretty straightforward to switch between them.\n",

    "(iii) calculate Spearman correlation between each model's predictions and human judgements; you should have something similar to the scores that are shown in the paper [2]:  "

    "Let's look at the first pair that participant50 evaluated: reference `child chatter` and high-level similarity landmark (as the last word in the row indicates) `child gabble`. The human gave the similarity score of 6 (very similar). Thus, human similarity judgment = [6].  \n",

The goal is to compare each model's cosine similarity vectors with human rating vectors and identify the model which outputs the best result in terms of being the closest to the way human rate similarity between the phrases.\n",
